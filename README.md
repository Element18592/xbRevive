# xbRevive
### xbRevive is a tool for flashing the Xbox 360 console.

At the moment it only supports flashing Jasper 512MB big block nand through the sidecar, configuration can be adjusted in SFCx.cpp,
support for USB flashers (NAND-X, etc) is a future goal.

A lot of the code is still a work in progress, so it may be messy and pretty confusing but I've been trying to clean it up as I go.
